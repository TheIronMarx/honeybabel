Goals of algorithm
	* Every set of honeywords generated must have the same pattern such that the output of the algorithm does not hint at the characteristics of the password.

High-level design
	* Given an input password, this algorithm should identify its characteristics and produce chaffing accordingly.
	* For a given k>30 sweetwords to generate, n buckets will be created. n-1 buckets will contain 5 sweetwords. 1 bucket will contain the sugarword and 4 sweetwords. Each bucket's honeywords will have a similar pattern.

Characteristic [zero, one, two, three, four, Eta]
	This refers to the number of digits in the password

Characteristic [alpha, beta, gamma, deta, epsilon, zeta]
	This refers to the number of words identified in the password.
