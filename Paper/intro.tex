This is the first section of the paper. It starts on a new page. Note how the left/right justification appears: text is justified on the left as well as on the right.  This section cites a paper by Juels and Rivest~\cite{Juels:2013:HMP:2508859.2516671}. It then cites a paper by Mazurek et al.~\cite{Mazurek:2013:MPG:2508859.2516726}. The citations are clearly described in the reference section. Note that citation format can be determined by the author. This is only one example.
